/**
 * Creates and manages Scaleway Edge Services Route Stages.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as scaleway from "@pulumiverse/scaleway";
 *
 * const main = new scaleway.edgeservices.RouteStage("main", {
 *     pipelineId: mainScalewayEdgeServicesPipeline.id,
 *     wafStageId: waf.id,
 *     rules: [{
 *         backendStageId: backend.id,
 *         ruleHttpMatch: {
 *             methodFilters: [
 *                 "get",
 *                 "post",
 *             ],
 *             pathFilter: {
 *                 pathFilterType: "regex",
 *                 value: ".*",
 *             },
 *         },
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Route stages can be imported using the `{id}`, e.g.
 *
 * bash
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import scaleway:index/edgeServicesRouteStage:EdgeServicesRouteStage basic 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
 * ```
