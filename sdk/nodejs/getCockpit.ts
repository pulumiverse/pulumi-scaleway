/**
 * > **Important:**  The data source `scaleway.observability.Cockpit` has been deprecated and will no longer be supported. Instead, use resource `scaleway.observability.Cockpit`.
 *
 * > **Note:**
 * As of April 2024, Cockpit has introduced [regionalization](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/concepts/#region) to offer more flexibility and resilience.
 * If you have created customized dashboards with data for your Scaleway resources before April 2024, you will need to update your queries in Grafana, with the new regionalized data sources.
 *
 * The `scaleway.observability.Cockpit` data source is used to retrieve information about a Scaleway Cockpit associated with a given Project. This can be the default Project or a specific Project identified by its ID.
 *
 * Refer to Cockpit's [product documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/concepts/) and [API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/cockpit/regional-api) for more information.
 *
 * ## Retrieve a Cockpit
 *
 * The following commands allow you to:
 *
 * - get information on the Cockpit associated with your Scaleway default Project
 * - get information on the Cockpit associated with a specific Scaleway Project
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as scaleway from "@pulumi/scaleway";
 *
 * // Get the default Project's Cockpit
 * const main = scaleway.observability.getInstance({});
 * ```
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as scaleway from "@pulumi/scaleway";
 *
 * // Get a specific Project's Cockpit
 * const main = scaleway.observability.getInstance({
 *     projectId: "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
 * });
 * ```
