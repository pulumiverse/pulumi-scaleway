/**
 * Add members to an IAM group.
 * For more information refer to the [IAM API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/iam/#groups-f592eb).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Application Membership
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as scaleway from "@pulumiverse/scaleway";
 *
 * const group = new scaleway.iam.Group("group", {
 *     name: "my_group",
 *     externalMembership: true,
 * });
 * const app = new scaleway.iam.Application("app", {name: "my_app"});
 * const member = new scaleway.iam.GroupMembership("member", {
 *     groupId: group.id,
 *     applicationId: app.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * IAM group memberships can be imported using two format:
 *
 * - For user: `{group_id}/user/{user_id}`
 *
 * - For application: `{group_id}/app/{application_id}`
 *
 * bash
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import scaleway:index/iamGroupMembership:IamGroupMembership app 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/app/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
 * ```
