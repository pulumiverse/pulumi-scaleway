/**
 * The `scaleway.observability.getPlan` data source is used to fetch details about a specific Scaleway Cockpit pricing plan. This information can then be used to configure resources like `scaleway.observability.Cockpit`.
 *
 * Find out more about [pricing plans](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/plans) in the Scaleway console.
 *
 * Refer to Cockpit's [product documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/concepts/) and [API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/cockpit/regional-api) for more information.
 *
 * ## Fetch and associate a pricing plan to a Cockpit
 *
 * The following command shows how to fetch information about the `premium` pricing plan and how to associate it with the Cockpit of your Scaleway default Project.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as scaleway from "@pulumi/scaleway";
 * import * as scaleway from "@pulumiverse/scaleway";
 *
 * const premium = scaleway.observability.getPlan({
 *     name: "premium",
 * });
 * const main = new scaleway.observability.Cockpit("main", {plan: premium.then(premium => premium.id)});
 * ```
